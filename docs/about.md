# About

## Contributing
You can help me by contributing to the library.
If you find a bug, please write it in [issues](https://github.com/ThomasBig/SWTI/issues).
If you write a code for a new useful function you can add a merge [request](https://github.com/ThomasBig/SWTI/pulls).
Keep in mind the new function has to be usable in any applications and game.
Excluding specific functions makes library simple to use.
