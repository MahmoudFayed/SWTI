Cursor which is used for printing colorful text on screen Keyboard which is used for detecting user keyboard input Mouse which is used for detecting user mouse input Window which is used for resizing window These four objects have in total about 40 methods to with console. Instalation The installation of SWTI library is easy. Download repository and copy the folder SWTI/swti to your project folder. It contains header and source code for the library. In your application, include a header \"#include swti/swti.hpp\" . Visual Studio - you will need to add header and source files to your project. Right click on the right folder header files and add existing file and choose SWTI/swti.h . Do the same for source files and add SWTI/swti.cpp . Code Blocks - click the left pane folders and add existing header and source files to your project. G++ Console - You can then use following two commands g++ -c main.cpp swti/swti.cpp and g++ -o main.exe main.o swti.o to compile your project. Change main.cpp and main.exe to whatever you prefer. Hello world You can use this simple example to ensure that SWTI library is installed correctly. Following code writes colorful Hello world on a specified position. It uses the Cursor object and methods setColor and setPosition. #include <iostream> #include \"swti/swti.hpp\" int main() { Cursor.setColor(YELLOW); Cursor.setPosition(5, 2); std::cout << \"Hello world!\" << std::endl; } Troubleshooting If something doesn't work, try to create a new project without any additional libraries other than SWTI. If you succeed, the problem is collision function names in the library. In C++ functions or objects with same names cannot be used. To solve this issue, you can create a namespace for swti, in which you include a header and the source file. #include <iostream> namespace swti { #include \"swti/swti.hpp\" #include \"swti/swti.cpp\" // source is needed } int main() { swti::Color color = swti::LIGHTGREEN; swti::Cursor.setColor(color); std::cout << \"SWTI Works!\\n\"; } You will need to use swti:: prefix for every function and object.

It is used every time you write a text. It is changed automatically but setting it manually provides a useful custom functionality. The unit of position is a single character . You set position of cursor by calling a function with specified number of columns and rows . The top left corner of the window is marked as [0,0] or more precisely columns = 0 and rows = 0 . The opposite bottom right corner is obtained using Window functions. The character count of the window tells you many characters you can write in the current console without. Characters are not screen pixels . The actual character size in pixels depends on many factors including screen size and font size . The default value is about 16\u00d724 pixels large. Check out font for more information. Color Cursor color can be used to highlight different texts and to make simple graphics. There are 16 different colors to choose from. They are defined in as an integer enumeration called Color . This means you use Color constants only by their name without using object notation. Hexadecimal value is presented only as a reference.

It is the color which is at the moment in use. Font Font includes font size and font type. You can't have in one application characters of different sizes and fonts. Setting font changes all text in console therefore should be called at the start of the application. A good practice is to change a font only at the start of an application. Font size is measured by size of one character. When setting a new font size you should be using a setFontSize() or setFontChars() . These functions change font size in respect of the console window size. It makes porting application to different screen size much more easier. For headers and large texts you can use a ASCII Text generator. When printing any ascii art, do not forget to add escape characters.

You can also try some proportional fonts like Arial , Times New Roman , Tahoma , Impact , Modern , Roman , Symbol , Segoe UI . However some of these are a glitchy and should be used with caution. You can also try other fonts. This image shows some of the fonts, but keep in mind that you can use only one font family at a time Constants The new versions of windows console stopped supporting ascii characters. You can use Windows 1250 or UTF . You can also use following constants in your code. These box-drawing characters will work in both old and new windows console.

Cursor.setFontSize(22); Cursor.setFontType(\"Lucida Console\"); std::cout << \"Printing some text\"; Functions bool setPosition(int x, int y) This function sets the position of cursor. When you call any standard function to print a text, first character will be on the set position. Next characters will continue right and down. The cursor position will not change if given position is outside the console window. Parameters int x - position in columns int y - position in rows Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if position was set successfully or position is outside the console window. Return value is false if unexpected error occurs. Example This example sets the cursor position to coordinates [12, 8] and writes there using C++ standard output, printf and putchar. Cursor.setPosition(12, 8); std::cout << \"Hello \"; printf(\"world\"); putchar('!'); bool setColor(Color foreground, Color background=CURRENT) This function sets the color of cursor. It changes the foreground color of the printed characters and optionally you can also specify a background color. This function doesn't change already written characters (you can use Window.setColor for that). Parameters Color - any color constant, foreground text color Color - (optional) any color , default is CURRENT, background text color Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if color was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example writes two texts on the screen. First is a yellow text without specific background color, second is magenta text with light cyan background. Cursor.setColor(YELLOW); std::cout << \"Yellow text without background color\"; Cursor.setColor(MAGENTA, LIGHTCYAN); std::cout << \"Magenta text on light cyan background\"; bool setFontSize(int size) This function sets the height of characters in console. It calculates size proportionally to current screen size. It is the most convenient and easy way to set the font size. Setting font size changes all text in console. Parameters int - new character height. Size 15 is approximately 1/50 of the console height. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if font was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example writes a text on screen with size of 28. Then it waits for user input. After user presses a key, it resizes the console size and adjusts the font size to new console size. Cursor.setFontSize(28); std::cout << \"Press a key to change the screen size...\" << std::endl; Keyboard.waitUser(); Window.setSizePixels(1280,720); Cursor.setFontSize(28); bool setFontChars(int columns, int rows) This function sets the font size in console. It calculates size proportionally to a given screen columns and rows. Setting font size changes all text in console. Parameters int - at most how many columns will font occupy int - at most how many rows will font occupy Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if font was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example sets the font to squares and writes a filled tic tac toe board. Window.setSizeChars(100, 50); Cursor.setFontChars(50, 50); std::cout << \"XOX\\nOXO\\nXOX\" << std::endl; bool setFontPixels(int width, int height) This function sets the font size in console. It sets the font equal to pixels. The result of this function depends heavily on console screen size in pixels. You probably should use pixel independent functions like setFontSize or setFontChars . Setting font size changes all text in console. Parameters int - width of font in pixels int - height of font in pixels Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if font was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example sets the font to Window.setSizeChars(100, 50); Cursor.setFontChars(50, 50); std::cout << \"XOX\\nOXO\\nXOX\" << std::endl; bool setFontType(const std::string name) This function sets the font in console. The most common fonts are Consolas , Courier , Lucida Console , MS Gothic , Terminal . Setting font changes all text in console. Parameters string - name of font Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if font was set successfully, false if any error occurs. Example This example sets the font to Lucida Console and then changes the font size. Cursor.setFontType(\"Lucida Console\"); Cursor.setFontSize(28); bool printChar(int x, int y, int character, Color color=CURRENT) This function prints one character on specified position. Additionally it can change a cursor color. To print a blank character you can use printBlank . To print more characters, use a setPosition and standard output. Parameters int - position in columns int - position in rows int - any character or Constant . Color - (optional) any Color constant, default is CURRENT Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, false if any error occurs. If coordinates are outside screen it prints nothing and returns true . Example This is example writes a horizontal symbol on specified position. Then it writes W letter if W key was pressed and hides it after release. Cursor.printChar(3, 2, DLINE_V, LIGHTBLUE); if (Keyboard.getPressed('W')) { Cursor.printChar(11, 5, 'W'); } if (Keyboard.getReleased('W')) { Cursor.printBlank(11, 5); } bool printBlank(int x, int y) This function prints blank character on specified position. To print a other characters you can use printChar . To print more characters, use a setPosition and standard output. Parameters int - position in columns int - position in rows Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, false if any error occurs. If coordinates are outside screen it prints nothing and returns true . Example This is example creates a simple animation of X moving to right of the screen. for (int i = 1; i <= 16; i++) { Cursor.printChar(i, 0, 'X', LIGHTGREEN); Cursor.printBlank(i-1, 0); Keyboard.wait(30); } bool clearScreen() This function fills entire console with blank characters. To hide only few characters you should use printBlank . This function is a replacement for overused system(\"cls\") . It is a more clean way to clear window. Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, false if any error occurs. Example This is example writes some text and then waits for user. After user presses a button, it clears the window. std::cout << \"Welcome in this awesome application.\"; Keyboard.waitUser(); Cursor.clearScreen(); std::cout << \"Do you want to show settings menu?\";","title":"Cursor"},{"location":"wiki/cursor/#cursor","text":"Cursor writes in console window all text.

Table of Functions bool Keyboard.get(int key) bool Keyboard.getPressed(int key) bool Keyboard.getReleased(int key) bool Keyboard.wait(int ticks) bool Keyboard.waitUser() Information Keyboard keys are integer constants. You can use them as characters 'C' or use virtual keys . Virtual keys are used without quotations e. g. VK_RETURN . They are defined by windows and can be found at microsoft docs . The following table summarizes the most commonly used virtual keys. Virtual Key Description Virtual Key Description VK_LBUTTON Left mouse button VK_SPACE Spacebar VK_RBUTTON Right mouse button VK_SHIFT Shift key VK_MBUTTON Middle mouse button VK_CONTROL Control key VK_UP Up arrow key VK_MENU Alt key VK_LEFT Left arrow key VK_CAPITAL Caps Lock key VK_RIGHT Right arrow key VK_RETURN Enter key VK_DOWN Down arrow key VK_ESCAPE Escape key Following examples show basic usage of the keyboard object. if (Keyboard.getPressed(VK_UP)) // UP arrow was pressed while (Keyboard.get('A')) // While 'A' key is down if (Keyboard.getReleased('1')) // '1' key is released Functions bool Keyboard.get(int key) This function tests if a keyboard key is currently down. It outputs true as long as the key is down. You can use a Keyboard.wait() to slow down a while statement. Parameters int - any virtual key or character. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true , when key is currently down. Otherwise is false . Example First example gets current input of 'W' key. The second example is while loop that loops until the spacebar is pressed. if (Keyboard.get('W')) { ... } while (!Keyboard.get(VK_SPACE)) { ... } bool Keyboard.getPressed(int key) This function checks if a key was pressed since the last call. Keyboard getPressed outputs true only once when key is pressed. Afterwards output becomes false regardless of the key state. To check current state of the keyboard use Keyboard.get() instead. Parameters int - any virtual key or character. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true , when the key is currently down. Otherwise is false . Example This function is useful when detecting single click on the mouse. Following code checks when mouse left button is pressed and then it prints a red 'X' on the mouse position using a Cursor. while(!Keyboard.get(VK_ESCAPE)) { if (Keyboard.getPressed(VK_LBUTTON)) { int mx = Mouse.getColumns(); int my = Mouse.getRows(); Cursor.printChar(mx,my,'X',LIGHTRED); } } bool Keyboard.getReleased(int key) This function checks if a key was released since the last call.

Screen is the full size of working area on monitor. The position and size of console window can be changed by user or by code itself. You can use functions below to get and set these properties exactly. The console window and screen size are different for each user . When publishing an application you should account for these different screen sizes. The easiest solution is to use Window.setFullscreenBorderless() and Cursor.setFontChars . The first function sets the console size to match the screen size and the second function adjusts cursor font to a given number of characters in columns and rows. For getting mouse position, use Mouse.getRows and Mouse.getCollumns instead of raw pixels. Window can be used as following example. Window.setFullscreenBorderless(); middle = Window.getColumns() / 2; center = Window.getRows() / 2; Functions bool setSizeChars(int columns, int rows) This function sets the console window size to specified number of characters. The result depends on font size. To set the window size to fullscreen use setFullscreenWindow or setFullscreenBorderless instead. Parameters int - number of columns resized console will have rows - number of rows resized console will have Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Setting size to low number of characters can throw an error, because the window is too small to draw navigation pane. One solution is to set higher font size . Example This example sets screen size to only 9 chars and prints a simple frame. Cursor.setFontPixels(30, 30); Window.setSizeChars(9, 9); Cursor.printChar(7, 7, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(1, 1, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(1, 7, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(7, 1, 'X'); bool setSizePixels(int width, int height) This function sets the console window size to specified pixels. Window is automatically aligned to center. Trailing characters are shown on the next lines. For new console information use getColumns and getRows . To set the window size to fullscreen use setFullscreenWindow or setFullscreenBorderless instead. Parameters int - height of new window in pixels int - width of new window in pixels Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false .

This function doesn't hide borders, top navigation panel is still visible and also the bottom application pane. If you want to fill with console to entire fullscreen, use setFullscreenBorderless Parameters This function doesn't have any parameters. Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Example This example resizes the window and writes three crosses in the bottom of the console. Window.setFullscreenWindow(); int middle = Window.getColumns() / 2 - 6; int bottom = Window.getRows() - 1; Cursor.setPosition(middle, bottom); std::cout << \"-x- -x- -x-\"; bool setFullscreenBorderless() This function fills the entire screen with the console size. This function hides top navigation panel and bottom application pane. This function is designed for full scale applications and games.

Window.setFullscreenBorderless(); middle = Window.getColumns() / 2; center = Window.getRows() / 2;","title":"Information"},{"location":"wiki/window/#functions","text":"","title":"Functions"},{"location":"wiki/window/#bool-setsizecharsint-columns-int-rows","text":"This function sets the console window size to specified number of characters. The result depends on font size. To set the window size to fullscreen use setFullscreenWindow or setFullscreenBorderless instead. Parameters int - number of columns resized console will have rows - number of rows resized console will have Return value Return type is bool . Return value is true if everything works, else false . Setting size to low number of characters can throw an error, because the window is too small to draw navigation pane. One solution is to set higher font size . Example This example sets screen size to only 9 chars and prints a simple frame. Cursor.setFontPixels(30, 30); Window.setSizeChars(9, 9); Cursor.printChar(7, 7, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(1, 1, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(1, 7, 'X'); Cursor.printChar(7, 1, 'X');","title":"bool setSizeChars(int columns, int rows)"},{"location":"wiki/window/#bool-setsizepixelsint-width-int-height","text":"This function sets the console window size to specified pixels.
